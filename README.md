# Password-Generator
This is a Python program that generates a random password for the user based on the user-specified length and complexity.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x

Usage:
1. Clone the repository or download the password_generator.py file.
2. Run the program in the command line using python password_generator.py.
3. Follow the prompts to specify the desired password length and complexity.
4. The program will generate and display the password on the screen.

Functionality:
The program generates a random password by selecting characters from a set of allowed characters based on the user-specified complexity. The allowed character sets are as follows:

weak complexity: 
lowercase letters only
strong complexity: 
uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation
The user can specify the length of the password. 
The program generates a password of the specified length by randomly selecting characters from the allowed character set.

Example: 
Enter password length: 12
Enter password complexity (weak/strong): strong
Your password is: X9sP#8?lRcYe
